1. What are some of the advantages to exploring datasets with a UI tool like Cloud Dataprep?
* __Dataprep uses Dataflow behind-the-scenes and you can create your transformations in a UI tool instead of writing Java or Python__
* Dataprep allows for quick visual inspection of your dataset with accurate frequency histograms for every value in a column
_Note : Dataprep only loads a sample of your dataset into the viewer for inspection. While you can control what type of sample to load, you will need to run the actual pipeline to view and analyze all of your data._
* __Dataprep has a number of transformation steps available that you can chain together as part of a recipe__
* __Dataprep supports outputting your data into BigQuery, Google Cloud Storage, or flat files__
